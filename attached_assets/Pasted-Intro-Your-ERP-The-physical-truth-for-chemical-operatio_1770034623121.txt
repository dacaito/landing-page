Intro
Your ERP. The physical truth for chemical operations.
Real-time inventory management for chemical plants to reduce write-offs, avoid stockouts, and protect production flow across raw materials, WIP, and finished goods.

Built for environments with high working capital exposure, strict traceability, and shelf-life constraints.

Proven results

- Inventory Accuracy >99%
- Write-offs Reduction 6-figure
- Days Inventory Outstanding Reduction Double-digit
- Inventory cycle counting Reduction >90%

The problem

Inventory sits at the center of the business, as materials dominate cost, risk, and production continuity.

When physical inventory reality diverges from what systems report, the impact is felt across the organization:

- Working capital tied up in inflated buffers
- Write-offs from expired or mislocated materials
- Stockouts affecting customer commitments
- Teams spending time on manual checks and firefighting

Despite mature ERP and planning systems, these issues persist because system data is often disconnected from physical reality on the shop floor.

The outcome

- Inventory accuracy you can trust by material, lot, weight and physical location
- Lower working capital tied up in inflated buffers
- Fewer production downtimes due to missing or mislocated materials
- Urgent purchasing eliminated at the source
- More productive use of workforce time, with none manual checks

A risk and flow protection layer for chemical plants
Vexgen adds a continuous visual verification layer on top of your existing ERP

By continuously aligning physical inventory reality with system data, Vexgen helps chemical teams:

- Detect discrepancies early
- Protect production flow from surprises
- Reduce risk around shelf life and traceability
- Safely lower buffers without increasing exposure

No system replacement. No process redesign. Minimal operational friction.

Who it is for

Designed for chemical organizations where:

- Inventory accuracy directly affects working capital and operational risk
- Shelf life, batch tracking, and physical traceability are business-critical
- Production plans are sensitive to material availability and WIP visibility
- Teams rely on manual checks or conservative buffers to manage uncertainty
