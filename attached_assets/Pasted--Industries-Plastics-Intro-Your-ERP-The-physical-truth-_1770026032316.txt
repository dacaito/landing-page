### Plastics

Intro

Your ERP. The physical truth for plastics manufacturing.

Real-time inventory visibility for plastics manufacturers to keep injection molding, extrusion, and assembly lines running without interruptions, across raw materials, WIP, and finished goods.

Built for high-mix, high-volume environments where piece availability, SKU accuracy, and line uptime directly drive throughput and margins.

Proven results

- Inventory accuracy >99%
- Six-figure reduction in write-offs and obsolete stock
- Double-digit reduction in Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO)
- >90% reduction in manual inventory checks and recounts

The problem

Inventory sits at the center of plastics operations, where throughput depends on having the right parts, in the right quantity, at the right machine, at the right time.

When physical inventory reality diverges from what systems report, the impact is immediate:

- Injection or extrusion lines waiting for material that “exist” in the system
- Excess buffers built to protect against uncertainty
- Finished goods piling up while the wrong SKUs are missing
- Teams constantly checking boxes, pallets, and WIP to keep production moving

Despite mature ERP and planning systems, these issues persist because system inventory is often disconnected from what is physically available at machines, staging areas, and warehouses.

The outcome

- Inventory accuracy you can trust by SKU, piece count, and physical location
- Higher line uptime by eliminating material-related stoppages
- Lower working capital tied up in oversized buffers and slow-moving SKUs
- Urgent rescheduling and recovery actions eliminated at the source
- More productive use of workforce time, with fewer manual checks and expediting

A flow protection layer for plastics plants

Vexgen adds a continuous visual verification layer on top of your existing ERP

By continuously aligning physical inventory reality with system data, Vexgen helps teams:

- Detect SKU and quantity mismatches before they stop a line
- Ensure parts are physically available at machines and staging areas
- Reduce reliance on buffers used to absorb data uncertainty
- Stabilize production sequencing and changeovers

No system replacement. No process redesign. Minimal operational friction.

Who it is for

Designed for plastics manufacturers that:

- Run injection molding, extrusion, or assembly lines with tight sequencing
- Manage high number of SKUs across boxes, pallets, and WIP areas
- Experience line stoppages despite “available” system inventory
- Use buffers, safety stock, or manual checks to protect throughput

### Food and beverage

Intro

Your ERP. The physical truth for food and beverage operations.

Real-time inventory visibility for food and beverage producers to reduce waste, avoid stockouts, and protect service levels across pallets of raw materials, WIP, and finished goods.

Built for high-volume environments where freshness, availability, and inventory accuracy directly impact margins and customer trust.

Proven results

- Inventory accuracy >99%
- Six-figure reduction in waste and expired inventory
- >5pp improvement in On-Time In-Full
- Double digit working capital reduction

The problem

Inventory sits at the center of food and beverage operations, where freshness, availability, and service levels define performance.

When physical pallet reality diverges from what systems report, the impact is immediate:

- Waste and write-offs from expired or forgotten pallets
- Stockouts leading to incomplete orders and OTIF misses
- Excess buffers built to protect service levels
- Teams constantly checking pallets, dates, and locations to keep orders moving

Despite ERP, these issues persist because system inventory is often disconnected from what is physically on pallets, in staging areas, and at outbound docks.

The outcome

- Inventory accuracy you can trust by SKU, quantity, and expiration date
- Lower waste through better FIFO/FEFO execution
- Higher service levels by avoiding missing or mislocated pallets
- Lower working capital tied up in protective buffers
- More productive use of workforce time, with none manual checks and firefighting

**A freshness and flow protection layer for food & beverage plants**

Vexgen adds a continuous visual verification layer on top of your existing ERP.

By continuously aligning physical pallet reality with system data, Vexgen helps food and beverage teams:

- Detect pallet-level discrepancies early
- Protect FIFO/FEFO execution without manual intervention
- Ensure the right pallets are available for picking and shipping
- Reduce waste without increasing service risk

No system replacement. No process redesign. Minimal operational friction.

Who it is for

Designed for food and beverage organizations that:

- Manage large volumes of palletized finished goods and ingredients
- Depend on FIFO/FEFO to control waste and freshness
- Experience service issues despite “available” system inventory
- Rely on manual pallet checks and buffers to protect OTIF

### Cosmetics

Intro

Your ERP. The physical truth for cosmetics operations.

Real-time inventory visibility for cosmetics manufacturers to protect product launches, reduce write-offs, and ensure the right SKUs are available across production, warehousing, and distribution.

Built for high-mix environments where SKU accuracy, variant complexity, and time-to-market directly impact revenue and brand reputation.

Proven results

- >5 pp improvement in launch and promotion readiness
- Inventory accuracy >99%
- Six-figure reduction in obsolete and expired inventory
- Double-digit working capital reduction

The problem

Inventory sits at the center of cosmetics operations, where availability, accuracy, and timing define success.

When physical inventory reality diverges from what systems report, the impact is immediate:

- Product launches delayed due to missing or misallocated SKUs
- Excess stock in the wrong variants while high-demand SKUs are unavailable
- Write-offs from obsolete packaging, expired products, or canceled campaigns
- Teams relying on manual checks to confirm launch and order readiness

Despite ERP, these issues persist because system inventory often lacks reliable, real-time alignment with physical stock by SKU, variant, and location.

The outcome

- Inventory accuracy you can trust by SKU, variant, batch, and physical location
- On-time product launches and promotions with fewer last-minute surprises
- Reduced write-offs from obsolete, expired, or misallocated inventory
- Lower working capital tied up in protective buffers
- More productive use of workforce time, with none manual checks and launch reconciliations

- Manage large SKU portfolios driven by packaging and market variants
- Run frequent launches, promotions, and campaign-driven demand
- Experience availability issues despite “in-stock” system data
- Use manual checks and buffers to protect launches and service levels

### Pharma

Intro

Your ERP. The physical truth for pharmaceutical operations.

Real-time inventory visibility for pharmaceutical manufacturers to improve batch confidence and reduce compliance risk across raw materials, WIP, and finished goods.

Built for regulated environments where inventory accuracy, physical traceability, and release confidence are non-negotiable.

Proven results

- Inventory accuracy >99%
- Reduction in release delays and shipment holds by >30%
- Six-figure reduction in inventory write-offs and obsolescence
- Stockouts reduction >50%

The problem

Inventory sits at the center of pharmaceutical operations, where accuracy, status, and traceability directly affect compliance and patient supply.

When physical inventory reality diverges from what systems report, the impact is significant:

- Batches delayed or blocked due to missing or mislocated inventory
- Manual investigations to reconcile system data and physical reality
- Conservative buffers introduced to protect availability and compliance
- Increased audit risk driven by reliance on assumptions rather than verification

Despite mature ERP, these issues persist because system data is often not continuously aligned with physical inventory reality on the shop floor and in warehouses.

The outcome

- Inventory accuracy you can trust by batch, status, and physical location
- Faster and more reliable batch release decisions
- Lower compliance and audit risk through continuous verification
- Reduced reliance on conservative buffers to protect availability
- More productive use of QA and operations time, with none manual reconciliations
